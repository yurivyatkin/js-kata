# FizzBuzz

This is a standard test task at coding inteviews.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
> But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
> and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
> For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

(cited from [1]).

This simple exercise immediately exposes coding skills of applicants [2].

In this kata I tried to spend no more than 15 minutes for the actual coding, acting in TDD manner (and succeeded).

Run `npm t` to see the tests passing (and review the tests to ensure that you are not fooled!).

A simple showcase script 'fizzBuzzShow.js' is given for anyone who wants to see the results in action.
