## Why I created this repository?

A friend of mine told to me that he was given a coding test, and he revealed to me secretly the tasks he was given to solve. The tasks were designed to learn about applicant's coding manner and ability to solve them within a limited amount of time. I decided to give it a try and attempted the easiest one, as I thought. Amazingly, the problem turned out to be not so elementary, and I spent a whopping 6 hours of condensed time, instead of the expected 30 minutes. That was an embarrassing experience, but along the way I learned a lot about myself, improved my training work flow, prepared me a boilerplate (configuring it took a fair part of the aforementioned amount of time), and had a number of enlightening TDD revelations. Reflecting on this experience, I returned to my old idea to make regular coding exercises. This is the reason being of the present repository.

## What is in this repository?

The statements of the tasks and their context are located in `docs` folder.

The completed exercises are placed in `lib` directory, where one can also find the tests, in `lib/__tests__` folder.

The file names should correspond to a task name, and the main function therein.

Features:

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/en/) for testing

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
