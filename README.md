# JavaScript Kata

## What is this?

Here I collect solutions for selected coding exercises.
I review them occasionally, if I find a better or more interesting approach.
There is no particular order.
This repository is just for my personal record.
## What is inside?

1. [Check HTML Tags nesting](kata/checkTagsNesting/Readme.md)
1. [Fizz Buzz](kata/fizzBuzz/Readme.md)
1. [Implement a "get" function](kata/mergeSortedArrays/Readme.md)
1. [Merge Sorted Arrays ](kata/mergeSortedArrays/Readme.md)

## Why I created this repository?

A friend of mine told to me that he was given a coding test, and he revealed to me secretly the tasks he was given to solve. The tasks were designed to learn about applicant's coding manner and ability to solve them within a limited amount of time. I decided to give it a try and attempted the easiest one, as I thought. Amazingly, the problem turned out to be not so elementary, and I spent a whopping 6 hours of condensed time, instead of the expected 30 minutes. That was an embarrassing experience, but along the way I learned a lot about myself, improved my training work flow, prepared me a boilerplate (configuring it took a fair part of the aforementioned amount of time), and had a number of enlightening TDD revelations. Reflecting on this experience, I returned to my old idea to make regular coding exercises. This is the reason being of the present repository.

## How this repository is organized?

There is a folder `kata` here, where all the kata are collected in one further level in subfolders.

Each kata subfolder contains a `Readme.md` file with the problem statement and some additional information.
This is usually the first file that is created in this directory.

The next file is `<kata-name>.test.js`, which contains tests.

The other files, e.g. `<kata-name>.js`, contain the solution that get the tests pass.

## Features:

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/en/) for testing

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
